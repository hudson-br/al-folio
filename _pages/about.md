Hi, I’m Hudson. I am scientist working at the exciting interface between mechanics, physics and Biology. I am currently a postdoc at MIT in the group of [Prof. Tal Cohen](https://tal-cohen.wixsite.com/website).

I received my PhD from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) under theguidance of [Prof. Lev Truskinovsky](https://blog.espci.fr/trusk/). My research focused on criticality in living systems. Critical systems are those that are on the brink of instability – they’re kind of like a Jenga tower that’s just about to collapse. When a system is critical, it can be hard to predict what will happen next, because small perturbations can have big effects. Learn more about my PhD work here: [PhD work](/al-folio/projects/1_project)

After my PhD,

<!-- Write your biography here. <a href='#'>Affiliations</a> Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
